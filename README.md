Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets and classify them into two categories: Racist/Sexist and Non-Racist/Sexist. The analysis involves extracting hashtags, tokenizing the tweets, and building a Word2Vec model to understand the contextual relationships between words in the tweets.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify tweets as either racist/sexist or non-racist/sexist. The sentiment classification is achieved by using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, word embeddings (Word2Vec), and hashtag extraction.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the dataset.
Handle missing values, duplicate entries, and irrelevant columns.
Perform text cleaning such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, etc.
Hashtag Extraction:

Extract hashtags from tweets labeled as non-racist/sexist and racist/sexist using regular expressions.
Text Tokenization:

Tokenize tweets into individual words for further analysis and model training.
Word2Vec Model:

Use the Word2Vec model to convert words in tweets into vector representations (word embeddings).
Train the Word2Vec model on the tokenized tweets.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical computing.
Gensim: Library for creating and training the Word2Vec model.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries for visualizing the data and results.
Scikit-learn: Library for evaluating the model's performance.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv sentiment_analysis_env
source sentiment_analysis_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: sentiment_analysis_env\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model is a collection of tweets labeled as either "Racist/Sexist" or "Non-Racist/Sexist". It contains the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each tweet.
label: Sentiment label (0 = Non-Racist/Sexist, 1 = Racist/Sexist).
tweet: The text of the tweet.
len: Length of the tweet.
